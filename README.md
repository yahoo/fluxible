## Development

All code is developed against the latest Node LTS version. This repository leverages [npm workspaces][] for package management.

## Publishing

The [changesets] library publishes packages to the npm registry. Use the following steps to publish a package:

1. After making changes to a package in your branch, run `npx changesets` and follow the prompts to choose which package needs to be published and what type of version (i.e., `major`, `minor`, `patch`).
1. Commit the newly created `.changes/<id>.md` file to your branch.
1. Open a PR with your changes.
1. Once reviewed and merged, the GitHub Actions `publish` job will run the `changesets` action and open a new PR with `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` changes for the packages chosen to publish.
1. Merge this PR when a release is needed.
