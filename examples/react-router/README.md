# routing with react-router

This shows routing on the client and the server with
[react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router). Navigation uses
history pushes on the client but browser refresh will render the
current page correctly on the server.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will use `webpack` to watch for changes and restart and rebuild
as needed.

Open http://localhost:3000
