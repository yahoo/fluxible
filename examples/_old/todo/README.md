# todo

This shows the full Flux flow from server to client as well as XHR posts for creating new todos so that they are persisted between page loads.

## Usage

Make sure you run `npm install` from the root of flux-examples. Then change directories to todo (`cd todo`) and run:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

This will use `nodemon` and `webpack` to watch for changes and restart and rebuild as needed.
