# routing with react-router

This shows routing on the client and the server with [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router). Navigation uses history pushes on the client but browser refresh will render the current page correctly on the server.

## Usage

Make sure you run `npm install` from the root of flux-examples. Then change directories to routing (`cd routing`) and run:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

This will use `nodemon` and `webpack` to watch for changes and restart and rebuild as needed.
